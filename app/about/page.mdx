## Work

I have over two years of experience, primarily specializing in backend with Python.
Throughout my career, I have played a key role in
developing systems that replace manual processes. Here, I have summarized my
work so far.

#### Software Engineer

<Company>InfoDevelopers Pvt. Ltd., 2022-2023</Company>

I played a key role in transforming a bank’s loan application and approval
process from a manual system into an efficient online platform. A key part of
my contrbution was integrating a third-party API from Core Banking system's
psychometric analysis into the system, which enhanced decision-making by
evaluating applicants more efficiently.

In addition to the banking project, I contributed to developing a government revenue-sharing system,
which calculated fiscal equalization grants for local governments based on factors such as population
and socio-economic status.

During this time, I also managed couple of interns, helping them grow into a valuable team member by involving
them in hands-on project work and offering guidance throughout their early development.

  **Tech stack:** Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, Celery, REST API, Docker
</Small>

#### Junior Software Engineer

<Company>InfoDevelopers Pvt. Ltd., 2021-2022</Company>

After joining the company as a junior, my first contribution was towards the development of a highly customizable content management system
for Nepal Police, using Django-CMS to tailor the platform to their operational needs.

I was actively involved in client meetings,
gathering requirements and regularly showcasing progress to ensure alignment with their expectations. Despite frequent changes in requirements and tight deadlines, I consistently helped the team deliver key features on time,
ensuring the system met evolving needs.

<Small>**Tech stack:** Python, Django-CMS, PostgreSQL, Docker</Small>

#### Freelance

<Company>2021</Company>

Before joining any companies, I worked as a freelancer, taking on smaller tasks in
projects from college seniors. The tasks included assisting in initial database design
with normalization and initial models. I also helped develop an E-commerce website
for a friend's startup with Express.js. However, the website was put on hold and cancelled during
early development because of the realization that it was going to be much cheaper to simply
keep running it on Facebook.

## Personal Projects

I love starting projects with the purpose of learning a tool or technology by integrating it on something new.
I’m excited about applying these skills in a professional
environment where I can contribute to impactful solutions. Below are few recent ones.

FPL Dashboard

I am developing a [web app](https://github.com/bimalpaudels/fpl_backend) that consumes the Fantasy Premier League API to extract and display
player data on a Next.js front end. FastAPI is used to handle API consumption, while Redis
optimizes data validation and minimizes database actions. A cron job schedules the API calls,
and the app is hosted locally using Kubernetes.

Job Scraping & Listing

I am building a job scraping tool that collects job listings from multiple online sources.
The backend, written in Python using Scrapy, handles scraping and data processing, while the frontend,
built with React, displays the job details like title, company, and requirements.

Personal Site

This [site](https://github.com/bimalpaudels/personal-site) is built using Next.js and is hosted on Vercel. I have used mdx to render mostly static
pages and also have integrated my Notion database to render dynamic pages I add there.
