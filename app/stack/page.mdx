## Stack

I have listed all the stack I like using here.

### Languages and Frameworks

The language of my choice is **Python**. I use it to learn AI and Data Analytics and almost exclusively use it
for backend development with **Django** or **FastAPI**, although I dabble in Express.js every now and then.

**Next.js** with **Typescript** & Tailwind CSS is my-go to frontend framework ever since I learnt about its existence.

### Database

**Postgres** is the main database I use, although I have worked with few other relational systems.
Recently, I've been using/learning Cassendra to explore more of NoSQL.

### Others

Here are cv-like keywords that are part of my stack but I haven't written above in detail(yet):

**_Kubernetes, Docker, Compose, Redis, MySQL, Flask, Express_**
